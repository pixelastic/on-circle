# on-circle

<div class="lead">
  <code>on-circle</code> provides a set of utility for configuring and running
  scripts on CircleCI.
</div>

It comes with a command line interface to follow a project, set environment
variables and trigger a specific job. It can also be used in a node script to
provide a sandboxed environment to execute code on CircleCI.

```sh
# Follow the current project to CircleCI
yarn run oncircle follow

# Set an ENV variable
yarn run oncircle setenv API_KEY=4815162342

# Trigger a specific job
yarn run oncircle trigger dailyUpdate
```

```javascript
// Run this from a job running on CircleCI
const onCircle = require('on-circle');
await onCircle.run(
  async (success, failure, repo }) => {
    // Run any custom code here, for example calling
    // external APIs to update some data.
    // You can even update the repo and push back
    // (check https://projects.pixelastic.com/gilmore/ for documentation)

    if (everythingIsOk) {
      return success('Everything worked');
    } else {
      return failure('Something is broken');
    }

    // Oh, and any error will be caught and transformed
    // into a GitHub issue
    }
});
```
